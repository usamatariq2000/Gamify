# Gamify
 Developed a digital games info and news platform using REACT NATIVE that used multiple third-party APIs. I used modern UI/UX design showing my front-end skills. I also used Firebase for authentication and Firestore for the database. It showed all of my front-end and back-end skills in one application.
